					<h2>Section I: Project Vision</h2>
					<p>[ACE: GroceryList App] :</p>
					<p>
						Ensuring that people can find and purchase all that they need for
						their meal planning. [ACE: GroceryList App]’s various features allow
						members to search for items in the store and add them to their
						personal shopping list. GroceryList is an easy alternative to
						writing down your grocery list on paper; a user’s personal grocery
						list can be accessed from any device. GroceryList’s goal is to give
						users confirmation of product availability and to provide a simple
						grocery list for each user.<br /><br />
						GroceryList will tell users about product availability at one store,
						but envisions eventually adding more stores to its database, giving
						users the ability to plan their shopping trips accordingly if
						certain items are unavailable at a single store.<br /><br />
						The GroceryList App plans to handle a large database of food
						products, allowing users to specifically find what products they’re
						looking for- whether it be for their weekly shopping or if they had
						a specific meal in mind. Due to the numerous varieties in brand and
						the many different kinds of products being sold, using a database is
						the best option for returning search queries to the user.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Section II: Product Features</h2>
					<p>
						As you can see in the examples above, it’s important to list the
						type of user(s) involved in each feature, followed by a concise and
						independent “unit of work.”
					</p>
					<br />
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Feature 1:</b> Users can login to our system with a username
							and password. Users must also enter their email after creating an
							account. This data is securely stored in our database. If they are
							a new user, they can click the “New user” link and add a new
							username, password, and email, which will add them to the grocery
							list system. If the username is not available, the system will
							prompt them to enter a unique one. If they are a returning user,
							they can enter their username and password to login. Returning
							users can check a “Remember me today” box that will save them from
							having to input their login info again within a 24-hour period.
							Otherwise, the system will only remember them for one hour.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Feature 2:</b> Five unsuccessful login attempts will block the
							user from the system, and the user must reset their password from
							a link sent to their stored email. The “Forgot password” option
							will also be available to users before the system blocks them
							after too many failed login attempts.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Feature 3:</b> Each user has a “Profile” page that lets them
							change their username, password, or email.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Feature 4:</b> A user can add to their grocery list from a list
							of items sorted by category. This will include categories like
							fruits, vegetables, canned goods, frozen foods, meat, snacks, and
							beverages. The initial list shows all food items. The user can
							narrow down their options by selecting one or more categories.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Feature 5:</b> A user can also add to their grocery list by
							searching the name of a food item in a search bar. If their search
							query returns an item, they can add the item to their list. If
							their search query does not return an item, the system will
							display a message saying: “No food item found.”
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Feature 6:</b> When adding an item, the user can choose the
							quantity of the item to add to their list.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Feature 7:</b> A user can view their full grocery list. This
							page shows the name of each item, the cost of each item, and the
							quantity of each item. From this page, the user can remove an item
							from their list, or they can increase or decrease the quantity of
							an item already on their list.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Feature 8:</b> The grocery list page displays the price of each
							item on the list, and at the bottom of the page, it shows the
							overall cost of the grocery list. These prices will update as the
							user changes the quantity of a particular item or removes an item
							from the list. If an item has a quantity greater than 1 assigned
							to it, the displayed price is the combined price associated with
							that quantity.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Feature 9:</b> In addition to having the capabilities of a
							normal user, an employee user has a menu option that lets them add
							food items to the overall food item list, remove food items, and
							change item prices.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<h2>Section III: Database Schema</h2>
					<br />
					<aside class="image-holder">
						<img class="image" src="DatabaseSchema.svg" />
					</aside>
					<h3>User:</h3>
					<p>
						This relation stores the users of the app. Users are identified with
						a unique username, a first name, a last name, and a password. A
						User's username is a unique string that is the primary key for the
						relation. When a User logs into the app, they enter their username
						and password, which are verified with the username and password in
						the database to authenticate their identity. Then, when the User is
						perusing the app, their first and last name may be displayed on the
						page, illustrating that they are logged in as themselves.
					</p>
					<h3>FoodItem:</h3>
					<p>
						This relation stores the FoodItems of the app. FoodItems are
						identified with a unique foodID, a foodName, a price, and a
						catagory. Every item in the grocery store is represented as a tuple
						in the FoodItem relation. The foodID is a unique integer that is the
						primary key of the relation. Each FoodItem has a name, a price, and
						a catagory that is associated with it.
					</p>
					<h3>UserCart:</h3>
					<p>
						The UserCart relation holds the data of what foodItems each User has
						in their cart. Each tuple is uniquely idenified by a userID and
						foodID pair. The userID is a foreign key that points to a User's
						username and the foodID is a foriegn key that points to a FoodItem's
						foodID. The quantity attribute is an integer value that represents
						the quantity of the FoodItem in the User's cart. For example, if
						User 'Colin' has 5 'Apples' in his cart, then quantity will hold the
						value 5.
					</p>
					<h3>Employees:</h3>
					<p>
						This relation holds the Users that are able to alter and update the
						foodItems relation. Employees are idenitfied by their unique
						username, which is a foreign key to the User relation.
					</p>
					<h2>Section IV: Project Management</h2>
					<p>Tools Used:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Version Control:</b> Our team will use Git in order to share
							code and to push our code up to the server.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Communication:</b> Our team will communicate using a group chat
							as well as meeting in person up to three times a week.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Timeline:</b> Our team will use the Gantt chart below to track
							the progression of the project and ensure we are staying on track
							to complete our objectives in a timely manner.
						</li>
					</ul>
