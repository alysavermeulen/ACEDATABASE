          <h2>Section I: Project Vision</h2>
          <p>Grocery List</p>
          <p>
            Describe your project vision. Explain the problem you’re trying to
            solve, and why you believe a database solution is necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Problem: Wanting to make sure everything on a person's grocery list is available at the store<br />
            Reason why it's important to us: Sometimes when you get to a store- you realize that they don't have this one thing you're looking for <br />
            Why DB needed: Food products will have many different attributes for
            cataloguing purposes, and grocery list items need to be consistent
            especially since it needs to check against the store's own database
            of products being sold<br />
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Section II: Product Features</h2>
          <p>
            As you can see in the examples above, it’s important to list the
            type of user(s) involved in each feature, followed by a concise and
            independent “unit of work.”
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>Feature:</li>
            <li>Feature:</li>
            <li>Feature:</li>
            <li>Feature:</li>
            <li>Feature:</li>
            <li>Feature:</li>
            <li>Feature:</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h2>Section III: Database Schema</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Design a relational database schema to support the set of features
            you listed. There are lots of tools to draw schema diagrams. For
            instance, check out draw.io. In your schema diagram, underline the
            primary keys, and don’t forget to draw edges for your foreign keys.
            For each relation, write a brief description of what it stores, and
            why it’s needed.
          </p>
