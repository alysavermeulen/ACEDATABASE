					<h2>Section I: Project Vision</h2>
					<p>Grocery List</p>
					<p>
						Describe your project vision. Explain the problem you’re trying to
						solve, and why you believe a database solution is necessary.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Section II: Product Features</h2>
					<p>
						As you can see in the examples above, it’s important to list the
						type of user(s) involved in each feature, followed by a concise and
						independent “unit of work.”
					</p>
					<br />
					<ul>
						<li>Feature:</li>
						<li>Feature:</li>
						<li>Feature:</li>
						<li>Feature:</li>
						<li>Feature:</li>
						<li>Feature:</li>
						<li>Feature:</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Section III: Database Schema</h2>
					<br />
					<aside class="image-holder">
						<img class="image" src="DatabaseSchema.svg" />
					</aside>
					<h3>User:</h3>
					<p>
						This relation stores the users of the app. Users are identified with
						a unique username, a first name, a last name, and a password. A
						User's username is a unique string that is the primary key for the
						relation. When a User logs into the app, they enter their username
						and password, which are verified with the username and password in
						the database to authenticate their identity. Then, when the User is
						perusing the app, their first and last name may be displayed on the
						page, illustrating that they are logged in as themselves.
					</p>
					<h3>FoodItem:</h3>
					<p>
						This relation stores the FoodItems of the app. FoodItems are
						identified with a unique foodID, a foodName, a price, and a
						catagory. Every item in the grocery store is represented as a tuple
						in the FoodItem relation. The foodID is a unique integer that is the
						primary key of the relation. Each FoodItem has a name, a price, and
						a catagory that is associated with it.
					</p>
					<h3>UserCart:</h3>
					<p>
						The UserCart relation holds the data of what foodItems each User has
						in their cart. Each tuple is uniquely idenified by a userID and
						foodID pair. The userID is a foreign key that points to a User's
						username and the foodID is a foriegn key that points to a FoodItem's
						foodID. The quantity attribute is an integer value that represents
						the quantity of the FoodItem in the User's cart. For example, if
						User 'Colin' has 5 'Apples' in his cart, then quantity will hold the
						value 5.
					</p>
					<h3>Employees:</h3>
					<p>
						This relation holds the Users that are able to alter and update the
						foodItems relation. Employees are idenitfied by their unique
						username, which is a foreign key to the User relation.
					</p>
